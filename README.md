# Notepad--
-# v1.0.0

A simple bloat free text editor I made in wails because Microsoft put Copilot into notepad. If you want to download it, there is the executable, or if you have all the requirements installed (Node, Wails, Go) you can build from source. Like always, Microsoft Defender will think it is a virus. I promise it is not, but you can look through the source code to make sure it is safe if you want.

If someone is good at art, feel free to make a decent icon, because I just did not want the stock exe, so I speedran an icon in gimp.
